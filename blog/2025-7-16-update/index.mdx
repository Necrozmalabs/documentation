# Introducing Code View & Editing for Experiments ðŸ”¬

We are excited to announce a **major new update** in the **Open Research Laboratory**:  
you can now **view the exact code** used to execute your experiments, and even **modify or rewrite it** according to your needs.  

This update gives researchers more **flexibility, transparency, and control** over their scientific workflows â€” making every experiment more **customizable, reproducible, and research-ready**.

Being able to access and edit the experimentâ€™s underlying code unlocks powerful opportunities for researchers. It allows full customization, enabling you to fine-tune parameters, adjust logic, or completely redesign your workflow. At the same time, it provides transparency, giving you a clear understanding of how results are generated and ensuring reproducibility.

This feature also makes it easier to incorporate code snippets directly into research papers, strengthening the credibility of your findings. Finally, by sharing modified experiments with peers, you can foster greater collaboration and accelerate collective scientific progress.


In short: your experiments are no longer black boxes. You have **full visibility and control**.


# How It Works

1. **Run any experiment** in the Open Research Laboratory.  
2. **Click on dive deep** section.  
3. Inspect the underlying code used to execute your setup.  
4. **Modify or replace** parts of the code.  
5. **Re-run your experiment** with the updated logic and observe new results.  

Itâ€™s that simple. What was once static is now **interactive and dynamic**.

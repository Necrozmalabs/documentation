## Experiments

An **experiment** in Open Research Laboratory is a virtual representation of a scientific test. You can include a single component (like a Multimeter) or multiple devices to conduct complex simulations. Think of it like setting up a real lab table — choose your tools and run your test.

## How to Create an Experiment

**Step-by-step Instructions:**

1. **Log into your account**
   * If you’re new, you’ll automatically receive **50 free credits**.

2. **Click on "+ Experiment"**
   * You’ll find this option in your navigation.

3. **Select Your Lab**
   * Choose the lab based on your experiment.


4. **Enter Research Details**

   * Think it like giving execution guidelines to your fellow researcher.

5. **Use Research Components via View**

   * Add components effortlessly using plain text prompts. Just say “add a laser”, and View AI will handle the rest.

6. **Start**

   * Credits will be deducted based on selected components.
   * Results are shown in real-time, but it may take upto 10 mintues depending on your experiment complexity.

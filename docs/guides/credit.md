# Credits System in Open Research Laboratory

Welcome to the Credit System guide for the **Necrozma Open Research Laboratory**. This system ensures fair, accessible, and trackable use of our high-fidelity scientific simulations and lab tools.

Credits act as virtual tokens that are consumed whenever a user runs a simulation or adds equipment to an experiment or workflow.


## Free Credits for New Users

Every new user who signs up on the platform receives **50 free credits as the part of Open Research Laboratory Early Adopter Program**.

This is more than enough to:
- Run multiple experiments
- Try out advanced components
- Build and test entire workflows

You can monitor your remaining credits at any time from your profile dashboard.

## Component Costs

Each lab component has an associated **credit cost**, depending on its complexity, data output, and compute intensity.

| Component                  | Example Cost (Credits) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Basic instruments (Multimeter, Oscilloscope) | 3–5 |
| Intermediate tools (Laser, Function Generator) | 5–7 |
| Advanced systems (Quantum Simulators, Plasma Emitters) | 8–10 |

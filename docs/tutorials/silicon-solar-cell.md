## About the Solar Cell

The cell is a monocrystalline silicon solar cell, optimized for high efficiency using standard layers including anti-reflective coating, passivation layers, and front/rear contacts. This solar cell is designed and tested in the **Open Research Laboratory**.

## Objectives of this Research

The main objectives of this experiment are:  

1. To simulate and measure the **IV curve** of the silicon solar cell under controlled laboratory conditions.  
2. To calculate the **efficiency** of the solar cell in different environmental factors such as **humidity, temperature, and light intensity**.  
3. To evaluate the influence of **layer thickness and material properties** on the performance of the solar cell.  


## Solar Cell Stack Configuration

| Layer Name | Material | Thickness | Structure | Bandgap | Purpose |
|------------|---------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) | Si₃N₄ | 70 nm | PECVD thin film | 5.3 eV | Maximize light absorption |
| Front Contact (Metal Grid + TCO) | ITO (100 nm) + Silver grid (3 µm) | 100 nm / 3 µm | Transparent conductive oxide + metal fingers | 3.5 eV | Conduct electricity with minimal shading |
| Passivation Layer | Al₂O₃ | 30 nm | Covers emitter layer | 6.5 eV | Reduce surface recombination |
| n-type Emitter Layer | Phosphorus-doped silicon | 1 µm | Heavily doped top layer | 1.12 eV | Generate electrons and form p-n junction |
| p-type Base Layer | Boron-doped silicon | 180 µm | Bulk wafer | 1.12 eV | Collect holes and provide mechanical support |
| Rear Passivation Layer | SiO₂ | 70 nm | Full back coverage | 9 eV | Minimize back surface recombination |
| Back Contact | Aluminum | 150 nm | Full-area metallization | 0 eV | Complete circuit and reflect unabsorbed light |
